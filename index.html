        <main>
        <p>When I was in high-school, I built my first PC under $800. Feeling proud I spent my time building and to configure everything
            perfectly. Something I didn't do was cable manage my PC well enough so I created many problems later on. My <strong>BIGGEST</strong>
            mistake was forgetting to connect my boot drive SSD, it took my way too long to understand why it was not booting to the right drive.
            I finally learned my mistake after taking everything apart again since I was a novice still. I felt <em>SO HAPPY</em> when I booted up my PC for the first time. 
            I was so happy that I took a nap before playing games.
